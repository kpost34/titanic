# **Titanic Machine Learning Project**
Predict passenger survival on the Titanic via machine learning.

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to build a machine learning model from a sample of the Titanic passenger data and assess its predictive ability on a test sample. The training data had 12 variables (i.e., passenger id, survival, and 10 predictors) with varying levels of missing data. Feature engineering was used to extract information from character variables. The process of data cleaning, feature engineering, model development, and model testing is described in a report.
